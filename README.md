**QuizMaster**

A Fun & Interactive Quiz Application
 Built with React, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS

**Overview**
QuizMaster is a responsive quiz app that allows users to test their knowledge on different topics, view their scores, and track their progress over time.
 It fetches real questions from the Open Trivia Database API, displaying them one at a time in a fun and easy-to-use interface.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate my frontend development skills â€” from API integration to state management and responsive UI design.

**Features**

 Topic Selection: Choose from a variety of categories (General Knowledge, Science, History, and more).
Difficulty Levels: Select Easy, Medium, or Hard before starting the quiz.
Dynamic Questions: Questions are fetched live from the Open Trivia API.
Score Display: See your total score and review correct answers at the end.
Quiz History: Your past quiz attempts and scores are saved locally.
Search Functionality: Quickly find quiz topics by name.
Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS for a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Error Handling: Handles network or API issues gracefully with user-friendly messages.
